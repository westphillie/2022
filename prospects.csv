0,1,,,Termarr Johnson,2B,18.1,"5' 8""",175,L,R,Mays HS (GA),,50,High,"Johnson has the most electric bat speed in this draft, and presents a rare combination of present power and potential middle infield fit, while also being one of the younger prospects in the class. The stocky Johnson is short but not small, only 5-foot-8 but physical and explosive (especially in his lower half), and his swing bears a mechanical resemblance to Bryce Harper's, especially its finish. Johnson's size is actually an advantage for his swing, as he can enjoy a bat path geared for power and lift without it being too long. While especially adept at launching pitches on the inner third, Johnson also shows some ability to shorten up and cover the top of the strike zone. The outer edge of the plate is another matter. Most of his swings and misses over the last few years have been on fastballs running away from him, so while his short levers help him in one regard, they also impact his plate coverage in another. This may eventually require an adjustment. Johnson also has a tendency to expand the zone and make some sub-optimal contact, but there are times when he does this and impresses you with his ability to identify and adjust to hanging breaking balls, his barrel feel, and his hand-eye coordination. While currently an incomplete hitter, Johnson also does lots of really exciting stuff you can't teach. His ultimate defensive home is tough to project. He can make a lot of the routine shortstop plays and is likely to begin his pro career there, but his frame is already maxed out and he may end up physically developing in a manner akin to Chris Snelling or Willie Calhoun, which would hamper his ability to play any position later on. It's realistic to expect him to be a shift-enabled second baseman. Brandon Lowe's 2021 season is a great example of what the high-end outcome for a profile like Johnson's looks like, but if he can refine his approach, the ceiling on his hit tool (and overall output) is actually greater than that",,High School
1,2,,,Druw Jones,CF,18.6,"6' 2""",175,R,R,Wesleyan HS (GA),Vanderbilt,45+,High,"The ultra-projectable, athletic Jones puts on a surprising show in BP for someone who's less physically mature than the other top-of-the-class players, and his range and instincts in center field suggest he could be plus or better there at peak (he's also taken groundballs at shortstop). He was only a 50 runner by the fall of 2021, but that could be the result of fatigue. Offensively, Jones' swing causes some consternation because it currently has him totally unable to pull the ball during games. He works back through the box and to the right/center gap. His ability to impact the ball with power in that direction is impressive, but that Jones can only do that is a bit of a concern. He is both ultra-talented and extremely projectable, and therefore likely to go in the top half of the first round barring increased concerns surrounding his swing's efficacy",,High School
2,3,,,Jace Jung,2B,21.8,"6' 0""",200,L,L,Texas Tech,,45+,Med,"While he had a rough 2021 summer on Cape Cod, Jung has been among the NCAA's most dominant performers, posting a career .322/.457/.678 line at Texas Tech with 21 sophomore homers. He swing has a lefty Chuck Knoblauch style, and Jung has the strength to slug with his all-fields approach. He'll turn on pitches on the inner third, and serve stuff away from him into the opposite field gap for doubles. Jung has had a tendency to stride open and leave himself vulnerable on the outer third of the dish, but this might be fixable with a small tweak to his footwork. Jung is very comfortable around the second base bag, and turns the ball around quickly as the pivot man on double play attempts. He'll end up with 40-grade range, but his ability to operate around the bag gives him a good chance to stay at second. He could be a 30 homer second baseman",,4-Year
3,4,,,Chase DeLauter,RF,20.8,"6' 4""",230,L,L,James Madison,,45+,Med,"DeLauter's hit and power combination projects to the middle of a big league lineup. Though he's best at golfing out low pitches, he's also capable of taking pitches on the outer third deep to the opposite field, and he shows flashes of shortening up, ripping his top hand through, and impacting pitches near the top of the strike zone. Plus raw power weaponizes this advanced feel for contact, while DeLauter's on-paper performance (.386/.508/.723 as a red-shirt freshman at JMU, .298/.397/.589 on Cape Cod) reinforces that all of this is very real. Though he held his own playing center field on the Cape, DeLauter's home-to-first times (typically close to 4.3, a 40-grade time from the left side) indicate he and his plus arm will end up in right field. He's a top five 2022 draft prospect",,4-Year
4,5,,,Peyton Graham,3B,21.5,"6' 3""",180,R,R,Oklahoma,,45+,High,"Graham was a rail-thin shortstop at a smaller Texas high school, and is now a broad-shouldered third baseman at Oklahoma. He has great feel to hit, a gorgeous, athletic swing, and a chance to grow into power. His breaking ball recognition will need to improve, but Graham's combination of feel for contact and physical projection give him a bigger offensive ceiling than some of the stiffer, more physically mature college hitters. He can't make ""all the plays"" at shortstop (where he played a lot on the Cape), but he can make most of them, especially when he's moving from left to right, and in on the grass. Graham's footwork, hands, and actions (all plus) should enable a pro trial at short, but it's more likely he ends up as a great defensive third baseman",,4-Year
5,6,,,Brooks Lee,SS,21.4,"6' 2""",205,S,R,Cal Poly,,45+,High,"Our 36th-ranked draft prospect as a high schooler in 2019, Lee is a switch-hitting shortstop with above-average power, but both of his swings are grooved and he has pretty substantial hit tool risk as a result. Lee was a coveted prospect as a high schooler but his strong commitment to Cal Poly, where his dad coaches, and some general concerns about his physical longevity pushed the industry's assessment of him down, and he went to school. Knee and hamstring surgery effectively knocked him out for the entire 2020 season, then Lee hit .341/.384/.626 in 2021 and had a huge summer on Cape Cod, with six homers in 21 games. His arm strength and lightning-quick transfer are clean fits at shortstop, but there are reasonable questions about Lee's long-term athletic future because of his previous lower body injuries and the current state of his frame and flexibility. He's of softer build, though perhaps has some reverse projection in this regard, especially since he was coming off a year with little activity. It's imperative that Lee stay at shortstop because he's likely to have no better than a 40 hit tool. Switch-hitting shortstops with power, even if they strike out a lot, are pretty valuable, and they can be even as they slide down the defensive spectrum, à la Brad Miller. This is where Lee fits, though his conditioning is a variable that could alter industry perception if it changes over the winter",,4-Year
6,7,,,Elijah Green,CF,18.6,"6' 1""",185,R,R,IMG Academy (FL),Miami,45+,High,"The son of two-time Pro Bowl tight end Eric Green, Elijah is the 2022 draft's most famous high schooler thanks to the way he began his junior year, homering a couple times in high school tournaments held in big league parks, and looking much toolsier than all but a couple of the 2021 players. He was seen a ton as a junior because he played at IMG, where lots of draft prospects from this year's class played. Scouts were blown away by his power and speed, but swing and miss issues were also exposed. Green struck out in a third of his varsity at-bats in 2021, and swung and missed more than he put balls in play during the 2021 summer/fall showcase circuit (several other top high schoolers put two times as many balls in play as they swing and miss; James Triantos had a 7:1 ratio). He is as gifted as any player in this draft, a 70 runner with 70 future raw power, but Green also has a gigantic amount of hit-tool risk that seems likely to dilute his game power, and threatens to bust him entirely. He can only consistently make contact with pitches down and away from him, and fouled off or misses pitches in most of the rest of the strike zone. Still, Green's ceiling is as high as any player in this draft if his whiff issues are remedied, in which case he could be a 40-homer center fielder",,High School
7,8,,,Robert Moore,2B,20.3,"5' 9""",170,S,R,Arkansas,,45,Med,"Moore matriculated to Arkansas early and at just 20.3 years old, will be the youngest three-year college player in the draft as a result. He's a twitchy, compact-framed middle infield prospect with sneaky power, adept at ambushing hittable fastballs on the inner half of the plate. As a 19-year-old in the SEC, he yanked out 16 homers in 2021. Moore has played second base in deference to Razorbacks shortstop Jalen Battles but he probably deserves a shot to play short upon his initial entry to pro ball. He's a cleaner fit at second because of arm strength limitations, but he's rangy and athletic enough to be plus there. If Moore can't play shortstop at the big league level, he'll need to hit enough to be an everyday second baseman since utility guys who can't play short are rare. Given that Moore seems to know how he can best do damage despite limited raw power, he has a good chance to do just that",,4-Year
8,9,,,Gavin Cross,RF,21.4,"6' 3""",210,L,L,Virginia Tech,,45,Med,"The powerful Cross had a tremendous sophomore season at Tech, slugging .621. Based on sourced data, he had two of the top 25 hardest hit balls in NCAA baseball last year and gets to it without a lot of mechanical noise. While Cross has a rare blend of power and bat control, his breaking ball recognition is not good, and he swung and missed at them at a high rate. It's a flaw, but not enough to completely temper excitement around the heart-of-the-order power that Cross brings to the table. He had a truncated 2021 Cape, which would have been a place to quiet those concerns. It's likely ACC pitching will make an adjustment to Cross and feed him a steady diet of spin in 2022. How he responds to that will determine if he's in the top five mix versus toward the back of the first round",,4-Year
9,10,,,Brandon Barreira,SP,18.4,"6' 1""",170,L,L,American Heritage HS (FL),Vanderbilt,45,Med,"The ultra-advanced Barreira has one of the deeper, more polished repertoires in the high school class and he also has among the best present command. When you combine his terrific pitcher's frame and mechanical fluidity with his stuff quality and command, you can run wild projecting on just about everything Barreira already brings to the table. He can work his fastball on the corners or run it up the ladder, he can dump curveballs in for first-pitch strikes or use it, or his slider, as a chase pitch, and even though it's his fourth pitch, Barreira has feel for locating his changeup consistently. He projects to have plus command of four above-average or better pitches",,High School
10,11,,,Logan Tanner,C,21.7,"6' 1""",218,R,R,Mississippi State,,45,High,"Tanner has rare power for a catcher, and he's performed on paper in parts of two seasons in the SEC, including 15 homers in 2021. He tends to spray good velocity to the opposite field and crush hanging breaking balls to his pull-side. He's strong enough to put balls out in either direction, and has a big, physical, prototypical catcher's frame. Defensively, Tanner is a below-average receiver with a 40 arm (it was better early in the 2021 college season) but he's a gung-ho ball blocker and field general. He has starting catcher offensive ability but needs a little more defensive polish than most first round college catching prospects",,4-Year
11,12,,,Kumar Rocker,SP,22.6,"6' 5""",250,R,R,Vanderbilt,,45,High,"Rocker looked like a first rounder for much of his high school career, but his stuff dipped as the 2018 draft approached while his asking price did not, so teams backed away and Rocker went to Vanderbilt. After some rocky starts early during his freshman year, something clicked for Rocker and he was utterly dominant from mid-April through June, culminating in a 19-strikeout no-hitter in a postseason game against Duke. That outing, and Vanderbilt's run to a national title, made Rocker a household name even among casual baseball fans. He made just three starts (and had some command issues) as a sophomore before COVID-19 ended the season. Then Rocker came out in 2021 in what looked like the best shape he'd ever been in, and with a slightly higher release point. He was fantastic early on, but his stuff slipped as the spring progressed (Rocker's fastball averaged 95 in February, 93 in June). His overall performance at Vanderbilt -- 236 IP, 321 K, 39 BB, 2.89 ERA against mostly SEC copetition -- was incredible, especially when viewed in light of his stuff's inconsistent quality. Those fluctuations became inextricable from Rocker's pre-draft profile, though. It meant most teams thought he fell behind similarly-talented, but safer-feeling prospects in the 2021 draft rather than being clearly in the top tier, but Rocker still fell a little further than expected on draft night, going 10th overall to the Mets. New York, whose rest-of-draft behavior indicated they had come to an overslot agreement with Rocker, was scared enough of Rocker's post-draft physical to squash his deal. It means Rocker will be draft-eligible again in 2022, though he won't be returning to Vanderbilt",ondemand_video,4-Year

Right now, he looks like peak Chris Paddack, sitting in the mid-90s with bat-missing hop, and a cambio with plus-plus fade and tail. Also like Paddack, Lesko lacks consistent breaking ball feel and finish, with his best curveballs flashing average. Lesko's stuff is neck-and-neck with typical, top-of-the-class prep arms, but the industry's fear around those arms, and its resolve that Lesko's biggest weakness (breaking ball sharpness) is difficult to teach, may slide him outside the top 10 picks",,High School
13,14,,,Jacob Berry,1B,21.2,"6' 0""",212,S,R,LSU,,45,Med,"Berry turned down seven figures coming out of high school and went to Arizona, where he raked as a freshman DH for a Wildcats team that made a deep postseason run. When LSU hired Jay Johnson away from Arizona, Berry was one of several players who transferred out of Tucson, following Johnson to Baton Rouge. He'll be a draft-eligible sophomore in 2022. Berry has plus bat speed and raw power, with an uppercut bat path from both sides of the plate. His barrel can drag into the zone at times, leaving him late on velocity on the outer third, but Berry can punish everything on the inner half of the plate with power. He still doesn't have a clear position, with first, second, and third base all in the theoretical mix, whichever is the most valuable position at which Berry can be passable. A stiff-legged athlete, he's in the 1B/DH range for us. Tucson is a hitter's haven, but if Berry even comes close to his 2021 production level against SEC pitching, he'll go early in the first round",,4-Year

Whisenhunt's fastball has sneaky utility at the letters even though it isn't all that hard, in part because Whisenhunt is a great athlete who gets so far down the mound that his fastball ends up having very shallow angle. His athleticism and modestly projectable frame create hope for more velo, but it's not a given. To ballpark Whisenhunt's draft stock, the apples-to-apples comp here is 2021 21st overall pick Jordan Wicks, another lefty with a great changeup, command, and a trait-reliant fastball",,4-Year

He also has terrific bat control and hand-eye coordination. While gifted in relevant ways, Young has middling physical projection, and will be 19 on draft day. He's a high-probability big leaguer whose feel for contact will need to carry him to an everyday role since he's unlikely to ever have impact power.

He takes a big (but balanced) stride and can adjust barrel depth by getting deeper into his lower half through contact. He also has a good foundational feel for contact, and actually put balls in play at a better rate than Mikey Romero did during showcase play. Holliday's range, hands, actions and arm are all average, while his baseball instincts and internal clock are very good. He doesn't have the overt physical projection of some of the other prep shortstops in this class (Romero, Flores) but he is the best athlete among them, and if we're looking at his parentage for indication (Matt Holliday), there will be strength eventually",,High School

Though he was wild, his arm strength and slider were plus. Sproat struggled with walks again in a 2021 relief role for the Gators, but he now has three plus pitches -- up to 99 with the fastball, plus mid-80s changeups with huge fade, long-breaking mid-80s sliders -- and might find more consistent feel for location with a shorter arm path. Because of the quality of his repertoire depth, teams may want to develop Sproat as a starter, which might require quite a bit of time as Sproat deals with a hefty innings increase. He'd move much more quickly in relief and would only need to make a grade's worth of strike-throwing progress to have a significant big league impact in that role.

He takes a very comfortable at-bat and tracks pitches with hawk-like skill, and his hitting posture helps him cover the whole plate and make gap-to-gap, doubles-heavy contact right now. Of compact build, Neal isn't especially projectable, so doubles power might be all he ever has. Likely to stick behind the dish -- of the prep catchers here, Neal's catching likelihood falls behind only Moore and Guzman -- a plus hit tool should be enough on its own to make Neal an everyday performer at a position with very few good hitters.

Like his oldest brother Andrew, he is a power-over-hit catcher whose size may impede his long-term ability to stay behind the plate. Susac is a lanky 6-foot-5, and this impacts his lateral mobility and ball-blocking, and has driven him to try to throw from his knees because it takes him a while to get out of his crouch at his size. His swing is also relatively grooved, but not so badly that he has a binary ""no"" hit tool projection. Instead, the realistic projection here is for Susac to be a passable defender with a 40 bat, which should still be sufficient for everyday duty because there's so much raw power here already, and more is likely coming. Susac still has lots of room for mass on his frame, though there may be a delicate balance between him adding strength and losing mobility such that he has to move out from behind the plate.

22,23,,,Malcolm Moore,C,18.9,"6' 2""",210,L,R,McClatchy HS (CA),Stanford,45,High,"Moore has a very advanced bat for a high school player, which is exciting considering that his chances of playing a premium position (catcher) are pretty strong. It certainly needs polish, but for a high school catching prospect, Moore's receiving is fine; his arm strength is mediocre but playable. His pop times ranged from 1.97 to 2.08 during summer looks, hovering around the 2.00 second mark with mixed accuracy and lackluster carry to the bag, but several of these came after Moore picked pitches in the dirt, or had to reach way across his body to reel them in. The carrying element here is Moore's bat. His strong, fairly mature frame already generates meaningful power, and it has manifested in games because of Moore's feel to hit. He can make contact all over the zone, and is especially adept at clearing his hips, pulling his hands in, and getting the barrel to pitches on the inner half.

He had 33 extra-base hits in 61 games as a sophomore in the SEC, while also playing excellent shortstop defense. Young's uppercut bat path punishes mistakes, but he's vulnerable to swing-and-miss within the zone, especially near the top.

He has fair feel to hit, and has some raw strength as a result of his prodigious size, but the quality of his contact tends to be mixed (he gets jammed a lot), and Collier's swing path really only enables him to work middle-away, toward the opposite field gap. It's important to remember Collier's age when considering these finer points of hitting.

His short levers give him mediocre plate coverage, something Brown can adjust for by altering his stride direction to match pitch location, which is harder than it sounds. His swing also has a clear hole down-and-in right now.

His fastball's shape does not enable it to miss bats as often as you'd like given how hard it is, and an axial change to his heater that might remedy this is easier said than done. Pallette's arm action is also fairly long, though he has good feel for location despite this, including arm-side feel for his firm, middling changeup. While he needs some polish, Pallette presents teams with an exciting foundation (present arm strength, spin talent that could aid the development of a second plus breaking ball) and traits (athleticism, body projection) that create optimism surrounding his continued development.

He has a picturesque frame and delivery, as well as a plus-flashing slider that has mostly vertical movement. WIlliams also has advanced feel for changeup location, but the offering is currently firm and lacks big movement.

He had a good freshman season for a rookie in the SEC then went to the Cape and raked, which he continued to do during his COVID-shortened sophomore year. His junior year featured an exorbitant number of strikeouts, but also lots of home runs: Fabian had the second-most strikeouts in Division-I with 80 in 270 plate appearances and was eighth in homers. The strikeout issues needed to be viewed in the context of Fabian's age: this was a 20-year-old center fielder in the SEC hitting for huge power. Ultimately, there was a gap between what teams were willing to do to sign Fabian and what he thought he could get in 2022 as a junior, so he didn't sign and went back to school.

Clifford will also cut down his stride with two strikes and rely on his strength and hand-eye coordination to do damage. He's more projectable than his age would indicate, possessing room for more weight and strength on his frame, which hopefully leads to more power.

He also has a tailing, plus changeup that induces embarrassing swings from high school hitters trying to cheat to catch his fastball. While his breaking ball seems to deceive hitters out of the hand, it doesn't have consistent finish and often sails on Porter. Its shape is promising, though. Breaking ball polish will give Porter a mid-rotation starter's repertoire. He shares some mechanical similarities with Ubaldo Jiménez, especially his stride direction, and this creates some relief risk. But while his delivery is intense, it also makes it clear just how flexible and athletic Porter is, and we're more optimistic about him starting than most pitchers who exhibit this level of mechanical violence and effort",,High School

How Stewart's athleticism trends into his early 20s may sap him of enough mobility to play the hot corner, but if he can keep things in check he'll give himself a chance to stay there. In either case, Stewart has preternatural feel for contact (he's especially adept at putting the bat head on inner-third fastballs) and the strength to do damage.

His upper-80s, tailing fastball has flat vertical angle and approaches hitters from the extreme first base side of the plate. He has trouble getting his heater to his glove side right now, which makes it tough to set up his sweeping breaking ball for swings and misses. This is a pure projection bet as Schultz needs to find more velo (which is likely, due to how much room is on his frame), develop more precise and diverse fastball usage, and better maintain his fastball arm speed while throwing his changeup if he's going to be a starter.

Flores is a pretty stiff athlete (especially in the lower half) and isn't especially twitchy, but he still finds acrobatic ways to make defensive plays that few of his classmates can make, often contorting his body and showing off his arm strength to do so, akin to Nick Ahmed. At the plate, Flores shows a balance of contact and power, covering most of the zone and hitting for doubles power right now despite fringe-looking bat speed. He has some frame-based power projection, but Flores' entire game would probably benefit most from a more flexible lower half, which might help his swing be more explosive and athletic. He also tends to chase fastballs above the zone. While flawed, Flores still has a carrying tool (shortstop defense) and general offensive competency (average feel to hit for his age, 45 raw power) that give him a floor of sorts, while some projectable characteristics (mostly his frame) that give him some upside, too",,High School

Barco's arm slot creates a flat approach angle, but he's not really inclined to climb the ladder and pitch at the top of the zone right now. His slider lacks nasty, biting movement, but Barco's arm slot makes it tough on lefty hitters, and his command of it gives it back-foot utility against righties. As a high schooler, his ultra-low spin splitter seemed like the more promising pitch, but his feel for it has regressed.

Hjerpe’s delivery is more akin to a low-slot reliever than a traditional starter, and his fastball has a shallow vertical approach angle as well as an odd lateral one, which college hitters have had a tough time dealing with. His slider and changeup are both average and flash above, aided by Hjerpe’s funky slot and his ability to locate. He works the slider east and west, while his changeup is almost always in the bottom of the zone or below.

He's a pretty good on-mound athlete with some changeup and breaking ball feel, living in this FV area while we wait and see if he can hold that velo all spring",,2-Year
82,COL-P-13,,,Alex Williams,SP,22.7,"6' 3""",210,R,L,Stanford,,35,High,"Williams effectively locates his fastball, slider, and changeup, demonstrating a feel for strike-throwing, and maintaining consistent arm speed and release point with all three offerings, using a low-effort, repeatable delivery. He doesn’t throw his four-seamer all that hard (low nineties), but his over-the-top slot gives it some life up in the zone, and his ability to locate it well to all quadrants allows it to play up even further. He messes with hitters’ timing by creating significant velocity separation between the heater and his changeup, which has movement to his arm side. He missed bats and induced weak contact on his slider, though its shape wasn’t consistent. He's a solid senior sign pitching prospect",,4-Year
83,COL-H-1,,,Andrew Pintar,2B,21.3,"6' 2""",190,R,R,BYU,,40,High,"Pintar has a rare power/speed combination for an up-the-middle college player and crushed several piped, mediocre ASU pitchers’ fastballs during the Cougars’ trip to Phoenix a couple weekends ago. He ran very well, posting several home-to-first times in the 4.1-4.2 range during my looks, which are comfortably plus, approaching plus-plus run times. Pintar’s swing is grooved through the middle of the zone, and a shoulder injury might be contributing to issues with his arm strength, but even projecting a 40 hit tool here makes Pintar an strong early day-two prospect because the showcase tools (power and speed) are so big. He’s been added to The Board",,4-Year
84,COL-H-2,,,Dylan Beavers,OF,20.9,"6' 4""",206,L,R,California,,35+,High,"Beavers is a physical corner outfield prospect with water-carrying raw power. His stance is similar to Christian Yelich and the college version of Hunter Bishop, but Beavers struggles to keep his long levers on time and he tends to inside-out pitches he should pull. He's high-variance power-hitting prospect",,4-Year
85,COL-H-3,,,Kordell Brown,SS,21.3,"5' 9""",163,S,R,San Joaquin Delta College,,35+,High,"A twitchy, compact, switch-hitting middle infield prospect, Brown has sneaky pop for his size but is older than the usual junior college prospect",,2-Year
86,COL-H-4,,,Anthony Hall,RF,21.4,"6' 2""",200,L,L,Oregon,,35+,Med,"An improvement in plate discipline has buoyed an otherwise well-rounded skillset, and gives Hall a shot to be a platoon outfielder",,4-Year
87,COL-H-5,,,Colby Backus,LF,20.5,"6' 5""",220,R,R,Walters State CC,,35+,High,Backus has thunderous raw power and generates it with a relatively short swing. He's a corner outfield power sleeper from a Tennessee junior college,,4-Year
88,COL-H-6,,,Elijah Pelayo,SS,19.5,"5' 11""",160,R,R,Mt. San Antonio College,,35,Med,"Pelayo needs to get stronger to make any kind of offensive impact, but he is a terrific defensive shortstop with a frame that suggests he might eventually have viable strength",,2-Year
89,COL-H-7,,,Chase Valentine,SS,20.2,"5' 11""",160,R,R,Central Arizona,Tennessee,35,Med,Valentine is a very good defensive shortstop with a plus arm and below-average bat speed. He is athletic enough that some scouts want to see him on the mound,,2-Year
90,COL-H-8,,,Jerry Huntzinger*,C/SIRP,23.4,"6' 2""",180,R,R,Xavier,,35,High,"A grad transfer from Seton Hall, the 23-year-old Huntzinger is coming off a senior season in which he lead the Big East in steals as a catcher. He has experience catching and in the outfield, and now that he's transferred to Xavier, he's also pitching. Huntzinger threw his first collegiate inning during a mid-week tilt at Louisville and only sat 88-90 mph, but he has a lithe, athletic frame, a good arm action, and he had literally just taken off his gear and walked to the mound. He's very interesting senior sign",,4-Year
91,COL-H-9,,,Maurice Hampton,CF,20.9,"6' 1""",217,R,R,Samford,,35,High,"Hampton was a famous high school prospect who turned down seven-figure offers to go to LSU, where he played football (and helped win a national title as a DB reserve in 2019) and baseball, but neither very much before transferring to Samford after a couple of years. He is very physical and fast, but has very little feel to hit and raw routes in center field. Hampton has barely had any baseball reps and only just began focusing on it. He's an interesting dev project but teams don't exactly have the minor league roster spots for a player like this anymore",,4-Year
92,COL-H-10,,,Brooks Baldwin*,2B,21.5,"6' 2""",175,S,R,UNC-Wilmington,,35,Med,"Redshirt junior Baldwin was drafted in 2021 by the Giants (15th round) but didn't sign. He's a plus-running switch-hitter with a slash-and-dash approach, but more raw juice in the tank than he hits for in games. He can make basic plays at second but really struggles with arm accuracy when he's working around the bag, so he might fit better in center field",,4-Year
93,COL-H-11,,,Caden Smith,1B,21.8,"6' 4""",215,L,R,Georgia Highlands,,35,High,"A kickback prospect from Mercer, Smith is a former catcher with huge all-fields power he accesses in the bottom of the strike zone. His size likely limits him to 1B/DH",,2-Year
94,COL-H-12,,,Kiko Romero,C,21.8,"6' 0""",185,L,R,Central Arizona,Arizona,35,Med,"The high school catcher and middle infielder has become more of a bat-first prospect at Central, though Romero indeed has a pro body and bat speed, and a great-looking swing. He'd likely need to return to some combination of catching/the infield in pro ball to be a prospect",,2-Year
